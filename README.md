## Topic
> Traffic Flow Forecasting During Covid-19 Pandemics

Our projects aims to develop a regional human flow prediction model with enhanced generalization capabilities and environmental adaptability using 90 weeks of data from New York City, which covers five features for 172 zip code areas(regional population, median regional income, COVID-19 incidence rate, POI, and regional human flow). To achieve this, we plan to use some typical time series model like AR, LSTM, HA etcs. to predict the number of visits in New York in future and try to apply a fancy temporal and spatial model called  Attention Spatio-temporal Graph Convolutional Neural Network (ASTGCN) to effectively predict regional visitation volume. So, in this report, we are going to compare all these time series models with each other and make the prediction.
